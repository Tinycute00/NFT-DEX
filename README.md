## Digital Gallery with Sustainable Artistic Value

## Core Narrative: "Art Exchange with Sustainable Value"

### 1. Gallery Philosophy: Art with Sustainable Value

Like physical galleries, each artwork should have its fundamental value:

- **Basic Value Guarantee**: Similar to physical art's "floor price buy & sell" system
- **Market Premium Potential**: Preserving artwork's market appreciation potential
- **Value Buffer Mechanism**: 90-day buffer period to prevent price cliff drops

### 2. Innovative Trading Model: Digital Gallery Renewal

Bringing traditional gallery operations on-chain:

- **Dual Pool Pricing**:
    - Base Pool = Buy & Sell price (permanently fixed)
    - Premium Pool = Market premium space
- **Liquidity Guarantee**: Can sell back to gallery at floor price anytime
- **Professional Pricing**: Partial NFT minting price tied to artwork's base value

### 3. Diverse Application Scenarios: Art Integration into Life

Building a comprehensive art ecosystem:

- **Art Tickets**:
    - Convert to collectibles after events
    - Retain basic collection value
    - Usable for merchandise discounts
- **Physical Art Tokenization**:
    - Lower collection barriers
    - Provide partial ownership
    - Ensure real value backing
